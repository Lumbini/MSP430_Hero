# MSP430_Hero
Version of Guitar hero for the MSP430F5529

The game plays a tune using the buzzer and flash the 4 multi-colored LEDs with the notes. The player will
play by entering the notes flashed using the buttons. If the player can’t keep up by pressing the buttons in time
with the song, he or she loses the game. This lab has several objectives, including gaining further experience
with digital I/O and understanding the operations of the MSP430’s timing, and developing experience writing
software which depends critically on the passage of time.
